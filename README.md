🌸✨ Hello there! I'm Reeteka Guttigraharam 💌 (@Reeteka) ✨🌸

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I’m a curious soul, a creative writer, and an AI/ML enthusiast blending the worlds of technology and storytelling. Here’s a little about me:

---

🌱 **Currently Growing In**  
I’m a final-year B.Tech student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I’m fascinated by how machines can learn and adapt—kind of like people! Right now, I’m diving into projects that combine tech and impact, like using deep learning for crop disease management and experimenting with gesture recognition using OpenCV. I’m also venturing into the world of **AI ethics**—because tech should be powerful *and* kind. 🌿💻  

✍️ **Writer at Heart**  
Whether it’s poetry, prose, or digital magazine articles, writing is my safe space. I’m a contributor for **Utopia Magazine**, where I explore ideas that spark joy, reflection, and connection. I also love journaling, gratitude projects, and scribbling bits of my soul into little notebooks. 📖🖋️  

💞 **Looking to Collaborate On**  
I’m always open to meaningful collaborations! Some areas I’m super excited about:
- AI & ML research or open-source contributions (GSoC 2025, here I come! 💪)
- Writing/creative projects, especially around tech, ethics, and personal growth
- Building fun, cozy digital spaces that feel like warm hugs

✨ **Fun Facts About Me**  
- Pronouns: **She/Her** 🌷  
- Languages: Fluent in **English, Telugu, Hindi** (can’t read/write Hindi though 😅), learning **Korean, Japanese & Chinese**  
- Hobbies: Singing 🎶, baking vegetarian treats 🧁, watching K-dramas & anime 🎥, and cozy gaming 🎮  
- I'm a proud ENFP-T (aka: the campaigner 💫)  
- I dream of working in **Responsible AI** and maybe studying in **Germany** someday 🇩🇪  
- BTS fan forever 💜 (Bias? That’s a secret… maybe 👀)

🌈 **A Little Philosophy**  
I believe in being gentle but strong, curious but grounded. I love exploring the in-betweens—where tech meets soul, where logic dances with emotion, and where small things become big stories.
